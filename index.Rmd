## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the effect of media and social media on the polarization of politics in the United States. I would also like to explore the effect of media on views regarding immigration, the LGBTQ+ community, etc. Another topic I am considering is the level anti-Asian sentiment throughout the course of the pandemic to now.
